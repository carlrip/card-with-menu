# Product Requirements Document: Reusable Person Card Web Component

## Introduction/Overview

The Person Card Web Component is a reusable, interactive card component designed to display person information in a consistent and accessible format. This component will be used primarily for internal staff directories and contact lists, providing a standardized way to present person data with interactive capabilities including profile viewing and contextual actions through a dropdown menu.

The component solves the problem of inconsistent person representation across applications and provides a unified interface for person-related interactions.

## Goals

1. **Consistency**: Provide a standardized way to display person information across all applications
2. **Accessibility**: Ensure full keyboard navigation and screen reader support
3. **Interactivity**: Enable users to perform common person-related actions (view profile, edit, message, etc.)
4. **Reusability**: Create a self-contained component that can be easily integrated into any application
5. **Performance**: Maintain fast rendering and minimal bundle size impact

## User Stories

1. **As an internal staff member**, I want to view person cards in a directory so that I can quickly identify and contact colleagues
2. **As an internal staff member**, I want to click on a person card to view their full profile so that I can access detailed information
3. **As an internal staff member**, I want to access contextual actions through a menu so that I can edit, message, or manage contact information
4. **As a keyboard user**, I want to navigate through person cards and menus using keyboard controls so that I can access all functionality without a mouse
5. **As a screen reader user**, I want the person card to be properly announced so that I can understand the displayed information and available actions

## Functional Requirements

### Core Display Requirements

1. The component must display the following person information:

   - Name (required)
   - Role/Job title (required)
   - Status (active/inactive/away)
   - Email address
   - Date joined
   - Location

2. The component must have a fixed size layout that cannot be customized

3. The component must display a "View Profile" button prominently

### Menu Functionality

4. The component must include a menu button positioned at the top-right corner of the card

5. The menu must be triggered by:

   - Clicking the menu button
   - Pressing Enter when the menu button is focused

6. The menu must contain the following actions:

   - Edit Profile
   - Send Message
   - Share Contact
   - Archive
   - Delete

7. The menu must support keyboard navigation:

   - Arrow keys to move through menu items
   - Enter to select a menu item
   - Escape to close the menu

8. The menu must close when:
   - A menu item is selected
   - Escape key is pressed
   - User clicks outside the menu
   - User clicks the menu button again

### Accessibility Requirements

9. The component must include proper ARIA labels for all interactive elements

10. The component must support full keyboard navigation:

    - Tab to move between interactive elements
    - Enter to activate buttons and menu items
    - Arrow keys for menu navigation
    - Escape to close menus

11. The component must be fully compatible with screen readers:
    - Proper semantic HTML structure
    - Descriptive text for all elements
    - Announcement of dynamic content changes

### Technical Requirements

12. The component must be implemented as a vanilla web component using Shadow DOM

13. The component must use plain CSS for styling with no external dependencies

14. The component must isolate all styles using Shadow DOM to prevent style leakage

15. The component must be compatible with all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

16. The component must accept data through attributes or properties

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Theme customization or color schemes
- Multiple size variants
- Integration with external design systems or CSS frameworks
- Animation effects or transitions
- Real-time data updates
- Offline functionality
- Mobile-specific responsive behavior
- Integration with external state management systems

## Design Considerations

The component should follow the design patterns shown in the UX mocks:

- Clean, card-based layout with subtle shadows
- Clear visual hierarchy for person information
- Prominent "View Profile" button
- Discreet menu button in the top-right corner
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Professional appearance suitable for business applications

## Technical Considerations

- Use Shadow DOM for style isolation
- Implement proper event handling for keyboard and mouse interactions
- Ensure proper focus management when menu opens/closes
- Use semantic HTML elements for accessibility
- Implement proper error handling for missing or invalid data
- Consider performance implications of event listeners and DOM manipulation

## Success Metrics

1. **Accessibility**: 100% compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards
2. **Browser Compatibility**: Functionality verified in all major browsers
3. **Performance**: Component renders in under 100ms on standard devices
4. **Adoption**: Component successfully integrated into at least 3 different applications
5. **User Satisfaction**: No accessibility-related support tickets for the component

## Open Questions

1. Should the component emit custom events when actions are performed (e.g., `person-card:profile-viewed`, `person-card:message-sent`)?
2. How should the component handle missing or invalid data (e.g., missing email, invalid dates)?
3. Should there be any loading states or error states for the component?
4. What should be the default behavior when the "Delete" action is selected (immediate deletion vs. confirmation dialog)?
5. Should the component support any form of data validation for the person information?

## Implementation Notes

- The component should be self-contained and not require any external dependencies
- All styling should be scoped to the component using Shadow DOM
- The component should gracefully handle edge cases and provide meaningful fallbacks
- Consider implementing a simple state management system within the component for menu open/close states
- Ensure proper cleanup of event listeners to prevent memory leaks
